Currently I've not found a way to declaratively configure vivaldi keybinds/settings and sync does not support either as of now (2025.04.02).

Manual steps required:
- Enable custom css in 'vivaldi://experiments'
- Set the custom css path to '/home/jon/vivaldi-css' under 'Appearance' in settings.
- Set hide status bar under Appearance
- Set theme
- Set default search engine to Google under Search
- Set address bar to bottom under Address Bar

See the images in this directory for keybinds in vivaldi

The following keybinds tabs should be fully cleared:
- Calender
- Mail
- Chains
